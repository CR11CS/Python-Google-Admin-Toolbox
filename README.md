# Python-Google-Admin-Toolbox
A Python-based JupyterLab GUI recreation of the 'Google Admin Toolbox' encode / decode toolset which has proven invaluable in my network forensics studies: [https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode/](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode/)

## User interface
![Toolbox GUI as rendered in Viola](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96323936/168412831-e093a88f-d345-4d51-a295-7c056129a32f.PNG)

## Notes

 - Intended for render in Viola.
 - SAML features weren't implemented since this was thrown together and didn't want external dependencies.
 - Added feature to skip all other options to get direct conversion of input to binary or hex.
